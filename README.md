## üìã Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of a mouse viral infection dataset, demonstrating a novel approach to antiviral treatment optimization through therapeutic index modeling. The work represents an innovative integration of machine learning, pharmacodynamics, and toxicity modeling to develop optimal treatment regimens.

### üîç Key Features

- **Advanced Pharmacodynamic Modeling**: Polynomial response surface models capturing non-linear medication interactions
- **Therapeutic Index Optimization**: Novel approach balancing efficacy and theoretical toxicity metrics
- **Treatment Robustness Analysis**: Simulation of dosing errors and calculation of safety margins
- **Interactive Visualizations**: 3D response surfaces, contour plots, and optimization landscapes
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Testing of different toxicity scenarios to ensure robust recommendations

## üéØ Objectives

This project addresses several critical challenges in antiviral therapy optimization:

1. Precisely identifying medication threshold effects and their interaction patterns
2. Developing a unified framework for balancing treatment efficacy and toxicity
3. Analyzing the robustness of treatment regimens under dosing variability
4. Creating a mathematical foundation for individualized treatment protocols

## üìä Dataset

The analysis utilizes a mouse viral infection study dataset containing:

- **Med_1_mL**: Dosage of first medication (1-10 mL range)
- **Med_2_mL**: Dosage of second medication (1-10 mL range)
- **Virus Present**: Binary outcome indicating infection status (0 = uninfected, 1 = infected)

The dataset comprises 400 mouse samples with perfectly balanced classes (50% infected, 50% uninfected).

## üß™ Methodology

The analysis follows a systematic flow from exploratory data analysis to advanced modeling:

1. **Initial Data Exploration**
   - Statistical analysis and visualization
   - Identification of key patterns and relationships

2. **Classification Analysis**
   - Construction of multiple predictive models
   - Assessment of classification accuracy and decision boundaries

3. **Dose-Response Analysis**
   - Determination of medication thresholds
   - Sigmoid modeling of response relationships

4. **Advanced Pharmacodynamic Modeling**
   - Polynomial modeling of response surface
   - Analysis of medication interactions and synergy

5. **Therapeutic Index Development**
   - Creation of theoretical toxicity models
   - Optimization balancing efficacy and safety

6. **Treatment Robustness Analysis**
   - Safety margin calculations
   - Dosing error simulation
   - Clinical recommendation formulation

## üîë Key Findings

The analysis uncovered several critical insights:

1. **Sharp Threshold Effect**
   - Both medications demonstrate extraordinarily steep transition between infected and uninfected states
   - Weighted dose transition: 5.49 mL
   - Synergy score transition: 30.22 mL¬≤
   - Perfect sigmoid fits (R¬≤ = 1.0000)

2. **Optimal Treatment Regimen**
   - Based on therapeutic index: Med_1 = 6.67 mL, Med_2 = 5.45 mL
   - Zero infection probability with minimized toxicity
   - 13.5% better therapeutic index than standard dosing

3. **Robust Safety Profile**
   - Significant safety margins for both medications
   - >90% success rate with up to 15% dosing error
   - Multiple viable alternatives for personalized treatment

4. **Complex Interaction Patterns**
   - Cubic and interaction terms dominate the response surface
   - Strong evidence of pharmacodynamic synergy
   - Medication product strongly correlated with outcomes (r = -0.95)
